Theme: Roles Reversed

Reverse tower defense
Platformer where you control the platforms

Need some kind of asymmetric design

Dating sim -> Don't get stalked sim
Shop management sim -> Play as customer
Try to survive in a city builder
Stealth game -> Find the intruder

Reverse / Flipping / Mirroring

Alternating turns

Platformer where you swap between two characters
	I like this one but it doesn't really fit with 'roles'.

Need to upgrade stuff to progress more easily through enemies,
but then you switch sides and need to beat other side
switching between player/cpu

Horror game where you play as the monster
	Can only move when player doesn't see you
		Can move stuff to block line of sight maybe
		Or move items around
		Catch player before they reach an objective
	Probably going with this one
		Remember Slender? Kind of like that
	You're a weird creepy tree thing made of sticks?
		Could call it stick man?
	Limited vision, but can see where player uses torch
	Uses up serious battery
		Player navigates more easily with torch
		But you can also find the player more easily
		Could somehow place betteries strategically
	WAS NOT FUN! JUST A WASTE OF TIME!

Frogger, but you're driving and have to avoid a swarm of frogs
